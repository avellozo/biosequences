  abstract={Xylella fastidiosa is a fastidious, xylem-limited bacterium that causes a range of economically important plant diseases. Here we report the complete genome sequence of X. fastidiosa clone 9a5c, which causes citrus variegated chlorosis--a serious disease of orange trees. The genome comprises a 52.7% GC-rich 2,679,305-base-pair (bp) circular chromosome and two plasmids of 51,158 bp and 1,285 bp. We can assign putative functions to 47% of the 2,904 predicted coding regions. Efficient metabolic functions are predicted, with sugars as the principal energy and carbon source, supporting existence in the nutrient-poor xylem sap. The mechanisms associated with pathogenicity and virulence involve toxins, antibiotics and ion sequestration systems, as well as bacterium-bacterium and bacterium-host interactions mediated by a range of proteins. Orthologues of some of these proteins have only been identified in animal and human pathogens; their presence in X. fastidiosa indicates that the molecular basis for bacterial pathogenicity is both conserved and independent of host. At least 83 genes are bacteriophage-derived and include virulence-associated genes from other bacteria, providing direct evidence of phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer.},

We then developed an approach for recognizing genes within such orthologous regions by first aligning the regions using an iterative global alignment system and then identifying genes based on conservation of exonic features at aligned positions in both species. The alignment and gene recognition are performed by new programs called and, respectively. performed well at exact identification of coding exons in 117 orthologous pairs tested.},

Two dictionaries are constructed, one from the nonredundant protein OWL database and the other from the dbEST database. These dictionaries are used to obtain O (1) time lookups of tuples in the dictionaries (4 tuples for the OWL database and 11 tuples for the dbEST database). These tuples can be used to rapidly find the longest matches at every position in an input sequence to the database sequences. Such matches provide very useful information pertaining to locating common segments between exons, alternative splice sites, and frequency data of long tuples for statistical purposes. These dictionaries also provide the basis for both homology determination, and statistical approaches to exon prediction.},

  abstract={PipMaker (http://bio.cse.psu.edu) is a World-Wide Web site for comparing two long DNA sequences to identify conserved segments and for producing informative, high-resolution displays of the resulting alignments. One display is a percent identity plot (pip), which shows both the position in one sequence and the degree of similarity for each aligning segment between the two sequences in a compact and easily understandable form. Positions along the horizontal axis can be labeled with features such as exons of genes and repetitive elements, and colors can be used to clarify and enhance the display. The web site also provides a plot of the locations of those segments in both species (similar to a dot plot). PipMaker is appropriate for comparing genomic sequences from any two related species, although the types of information that can be inferred (e.g., protein-coding regions and cis-regulatory elements) depend on the level of conservation and the time and divergence rate since the separation of the species. Gene regulatory elements are often detectable as similar, noncoding sequences in species that diverged as much as 100-300 million years ago, such as humans and mice, Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae, or Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. PipMaker supports analysis of unfinished or "working draft" sequences by permitting one of the two sequences to be in unoriented and unordered contigs.},

A major factor in its prominence as a pathogen is its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants. Here we report the complete sequence of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. At 6.3 million base pairs, this is the largest bacterial genome sequenced, and the sequence provides insights into the basis of the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of P. aeruginosa. Consistent with its larger genome size and environmental adaptability, P. aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large number of genes involved in the catabolism, transport and efflux of organic compounds as well as four potential chemotaxis systems. We propose that the size and complexity of the P. aeruginosa genome reflect an evolutionary adaptation permitting it to thrive in diverse environments and resist the effects of a variety of antimicrobial substances.},

  abstract={Rice (Oryza sativa) is a model species for monocotyledonous plants, especially for members in the grass family. Several attributes such as small genome size, diploid nature, transformability, and establishment of genetic and molecular resources make it a tractable organism for plant biologists. With an estimated genome size of 430 Mb (Arumuganathan and Earle, 1991), it is feasible to obtain the complete genome sequence of rice using current technologies. An international effort has been established and is in the process of sequencing O. sativa spp. japonica var "Nipponbare" using a bacterial artificial chromosome/P1 artificial chromosome shotgun sequencing strategy. Annotation of the rice genome is performed using prediction-based and homology-based searches to identify genes. Annotation tools such as optimized gene prediction programs are being developed for rice to improve the quality of annotation. Resources are also being developed to leverage the rice genome sequence to partial genome projects such as expressed sequence tag projects, thereby maximizing the output from the rice genome project. To provide a low level of annotation for rice genomic sequences, we have aligned all rice bacterial artificial chromosome/P1 artificial chromosome sequences with The Institute of Genomic Research Gene Indices that are a set of nonredundant transcripts that are generated from nine public plant expressed sequence tag projects (rice, wheat, sorghum, maize, barley, Arabidopsis, tomato, potato, and barrel medic). In addition, we have used data from The Institute of Genomic Research Gene Indices and the Arabidopsis and Rice Genome Projects to identify putative orthologues and paralogues among these nine genomes.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Whole-genome comparisons can provide great insight into many aspects of biology. Until recently, however, comparisons were mainly possible only between distantly related species. Complete genome sequences are now becoming available from multiple sets of closely related strains or species. RESULTS: By comparing the recently completed genome sequences of Vibrio cholerae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis to those of closely related species - Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes and Mycobacterium leprae, respectively - we have identified an unusual and previously unobserved feature of bacterial genome structure. Scatterplots of the conserved sequences (both DNA and protein) between each pair of species produce a distinct X-shaped pattern, which we call an X-alignment. The key feature of these alignments is that they have symmetry around the replication origin and terminus; that is, the distance of a particular conserved feature (DNA or protein) from the replication origin (or terminus) is conserved between closely related pairs of species. Statistically significant X-alignments are also found within some genomes, indicating that there is symmetry about the replication origin for paralogous features as well. CONCLUSIONS: The most likely mechanism of generation of X-alignments involves large chromosomal inversions that reverse the genomic sequence symmetrically around the origin of replication. The finding of these X-alignments between many pairs of species suggests that chromosomal inversions around the origin are a common feature of bacterial genome evolution.},

Each COG represented a family of gene products conserved across several herpes genomes. These families were defined without using an arbitrary threshold criterion based on sequence similarity. The COG technique was modified so that variable stringency in COG construction was possible. High stringencies identify a core set of highly conserved genes. Varying COG stringency reveals differences in the degree of conservation between functional classes of genes. The COG data were used to construct whole-genome phylogenetic trees based on gene content. These trees agree well with trees based on other methods and are robust when tested by bootstrap analysis. The COG data also were used to construct a reciprocal tree that clustered genes with similar phylogenetic profiles. This clustering may give clues to genes with related functions or with related histories of acquisition and loss during herpesvirus evolution.},

To put these genomic trees into perspective, we compared them to the traditional ribosomal phylogeny and also to trees based on the sequence similarity of individual orthologous proteins. We found that our genomic trees based on the overall occurrence of orthologs did not agree well with the traditional tree. This discrepancy, however, vanished when one restricted the tree to proteins involved in transcription and translation, not including problematic proteins involved in metabolism. Protein folds unite superficially unrelated sequence families and represent a most fundamental molecular unit described by genomes. We found that our genomic occurrence tree based on folds agreed fairly well with the traditional ribosomal phylogeny. Surprisingly, despite this overall agreement, certain classes of folds, particularly all-beta ones, had a somewhat different phylogenetic distribution. We also compared our occurrence trees to whole-genome clusters based on the composition of amino acids and di-nucleotides. Finally, we analyzed some technical aspects of genomic trees-e.g., comparing parsimony versus distance-based approaches and examining the effects of increasing numbers of organisms.

The proteins that belong to these conserved euryarchaeal families comprise 31%-35% of the gene complement and may be considered the evolutionarily stable core of the archaeal genomes. The core gene set includes the great majority of genes coding for proteins involved in genome replication and expression, but only a relatively small subset of metabolic functions. For many gene families that are conserved in all euryarchaea, previously undetected orthologs in bacteria and eukaryotes were identified. A number of euryarchaeal synapomorphies (unique shared characters) were identified; these are protein families that possess sequence signatures or domain architectures that are conserved in all euryarchaea but are not found in bacteria or eukaryotes. In addition, euryarchaea-specific expansions of several protein and domain families were detected. In terms of their apparent phylogenetic affinities, the archaeal protein families split into bacterial and eukaryotic families. The majority of the proteins that have only eukaryotic orthologs or show the greatest similarity to their eukaryotic counterparts belong to the core set. The families of euryarchaeal genes that are conserved in only two or three species constitute a relatively mobile component of the genomes whose evolution should have involved multiple events of lineage-specific gene loss and horizontal gene transfer. Frequently these proteins have detectable orthologs only in bacteria or show the greatest similarity to the bacterial homologs, which might suggest a significant role of horizontal gene transfer from bacteria in the evolution of the euryarchaeota.},

We used the database of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) to reannotate the genomes of two archaea, Aeropyrum pernix, the first member of the Crenarchaea to be sequenced, and Pyrococcus abyssi. RESULTS: A. pernix and P. abyssi proteins were assigned to COGs using the COGNITOR program; the results were verified on a case-by-case basis and augmented by additional database searches using the PSI-BLAST and TBLASTN programs. Functions were predicted for over 300 proteins from A. pernix, which could not be assigned a function using conventional methods with a conservative sequence similarity threshold, an approximately 50% increase compared to the original annotation. A. pernix shares most of the conserved core of proteins that were previously identified in the Euryarchaeota. Cluster analysis or distance matrix tree construction based on the co-occurrence of genomes in COGs showed that A. pernix forms a distinct group within the archaea, although grouping with the two species of Pyrococci, indicative of similar repertoires of conserved genes, was observed. No indication of a specific relationship between Crenarchaeota and eukaryotes was obtained in these analyses. Several proteins that are conserved in Euryarchaeota and most bacteria are unexpectedly missing in A. pernix, including the entire set of de novo purine biosynthesis enzymes, the GTPase FtsZ (a key component of the bacterial and euryarchaeal cell-division machinery), and the tRNA-specific pseudouridine synthase, previously considered universal. A. pernix is represented in 48 COGs that do not contain any euryarchaeal members. Many of these proteins are TCA cycle and electron transport chain enzymes, reflecting the aerobic lifestyle of A. pernix. CONCLUSIONS: Special-purpose databases organized on the basis of phylogenetic analysis and carefully curated with respect to known and predicted protein functions provide for a significant improvement in genome annotation. A differential genome display approach helps in a systematic investigation of common and distinct features of gene repertoires and in some cases reveals unexpected connections that may be indicative of functional similarities between phylogenetically distant organisms and of lateral gene exchange.},

Rigorous optimization of the 'sum of pairs' (SP) score is achieved by algorithm D, whose average performance is close to O(MNL2), where M and N are numbers of sequences included in the two groups and L is the mean length of the sequences. Algorithm B uses some approximations to cope with profile-based operations, whereas algorithm C is a simpler variant of algorithm D.

The comparison is in the form of a census (or comprehensive accounting) of the relative occurrence of secondary and tertiary structures in the genomes, which particular emphasis on patterns of supersecondary structure. Comparison of secondary structure shows that the three genomes have nearly the same overall secondary-structure content, although they differ markedly in amino acid composition. Comparison of super-secondary structure, using a novel "frequent-words" approach, shows that yeast has a preponderance of consecutive strands (e.g. beta-beta-beta patterns), Haemophilus, consecutive helices (alpha-alpha-alpha), and Methanococcus, alternating helix-strand structures (beta-alpha-beta). Yeast also has significantly more helical membrane proteins than the other two genomes, with most of the differences concentrated in proteins containing two transmembrane segments. Comparison of tertiary structure (by sequence matching and domain-level clustering) highlights the substantial duplication in each genome (approximately 30% to 50%), with the degree of duplication following similar patterns in all three. Many sequence families are shared among the genomes, with the degree of overlap between any two genomes being roughly similar. In total, the three genomes contain 148 of the approximately 300 known protein folds. Forty-five of these 148 that are present in all three genomes are especially enriched in mixed super-secondary structures (alpha/beta). Moreover, the five most common of these 45 (the "top-5") have a remarkably similar super-secondary structure architecture, containing a central sheet of parallel strands with helices packed onto at least one face and beta-alpha-beta connections between adjacent strands. These most basic molecular parts, which, presumably, were present in the last common ancestor to the three Kingdoms, include the TIM-barrel, Rossmann, flavodoxin, thiamin-binding, and P-loop-hydrolase folds.},

Between 75% and 90% of the predicted proteins encoded in each of the bacterial genomes and 73% of the M. jannaschii proteins showed significant sequence similarity to proteins from other species. The fraction of bacterial and archaeal proteins containing regions conserved over long phylogenetic distances is nearly the same and close to 70%. Functions of 70-85% of the bacterial proteins and about 70% of the archaeal proteins were predicted with varying precision. This contrasts with the previous report that more than half of the archaeal proteins have no homologues and shows that, with more sensitive methods and detailed analysis of conserved motifs, archaeal genomes become as amenable to meaningful interpretation by computer as bacterial genomes. The analysis of conserved motifs resulted in the prediction of a number of previously undetected functions of bacterial and archaeal proteins and in the identification of novel protein families. In spite of the generally high conservation of protein sequences, orthologues of 25% or less of the M. jannaschii genes were detected in each individual completely sequenced genome, supporting the uniqueness of archaea as a distinct domain of life. About 53% of the M. jannaschii proteins belong to families of paralogues, a fraction similar to that in bacteria with larger genomes, such as Synechocystis sp. and Escherichia coli, but higher than that in H. influenzae, which has approximately the same number of genes as M. jannaschii. Certain groups of proteins, e.g. molecular chaperones and DNA repair enzymes, thought to be ubiquitous and represented in the minimal gene set derived by bacterial genome comparison, are missing in M. jannaschii, indicating massive non-orthologous displacement of genes responsible for essential functions. An unexpectedly large fraction of the M. jannaschii gene products, 44%, shows significantly higher similarity to bacterial than to eukaryotic proteins, compared with 13% that have eukaryotic proteins as their closest homologues (the rest of the proteins show approximately the same level of similarity to bacterial and eukaryotic homologues or have no homologues). Proteins involved in translation, transcription, replication and protein secretion are most closely related to eukaryotic proteins, whereas metabolic enzymes, metabolite uptake systems, enzymes for cell wall biosynthesis and many uncharacterized proteins appear to be 'bacterial'. A similar prevalence of proteins of apparent bacterial origin was observed among the currently available sequences from the distantly related archaeal genus, Sulfolobus. It is likely that the evolution of archaea included at least one major merger between ancestral cells from the bacterial lineage and the lineage leading to the eukaryotic nucleocytoplasm.},

The vast pool of genes in plants, however, will be an important resource for insertion of genes, via biotechnological procedures, into an array of plants, generating unique germ plasms not achievable by conventional breeding. It just became clear that genomes of grasses have evolved in a manner analogous to Lego blocks. Large chromosome segments have been reshuffled and stuffer pieces added between genes. Although some genomes have become very large, the genome with the fewest stuffer pieces, the rice genome, is the Rosetta Stone of all the bigger grass genomes. This means that sequencing the rice genome as anchor genome of the grasses will provide instantaneous access to the same genes in the same relative physical position in other grasses (e.g., corn and wheat), without the need to sequence each of these genomes independently. (i) The sequencing of the entire genome of rice as anchor genome for the grasses will accelerate plant gene discovery in many important crops (e.g., corn, wheat, and rice) by several orders of magnitudes and reduce research and development costs for government and industry at a faster pace. (ii) Costs for sequencing entire genomes have come down significantly. Because of its size, rice is only 12% of the human or the corn genome, and technology improvements by the human genome project are completely transferable, translating in another 50% reduction of the costs. (iii) The physical mapping of the rice genome by a group of Japanese researchers provides a jump start for sequencing the genome and forming an international consortium. Otherwise, other countries would do it alone and own proprietary positions.},

Learning sets for the detection of regulatory sites were constructed using the available experimental data on archaeal transcription regulation or by analogy with known bacterial regulons, and further analysis was performed using iterative profile searches. The information content of the candidate signals detected by this method is insufficient for reliable predictions to be made. Therefore, this approach has to be complemented by examination of evolutionary conservation in different archaeal genomes. This combined strategy resulted in the prediction of a conserved heat shock regulon in all euryarchaea, a nitrogen fixation regulon in the methanogens Methanococcus jannaschii and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and an aromatic amino acid regulon in M.thermoautotrophicum. Unexpectedly, the heat shock regulatory site was detected not only for genes that encode known chaperone proteins but also for archaeal histone genes. This suggests a possible function for archaeal histones in stress-related changes in DNA condensation. In addition, comparative analysis of the genomes of three Pyrococcus species resulted in the prediction of their purine metabolism and transport regulon. The results demonstrate the feasibility of prediction of at least some transcription regulatory sites by comparing poorly characterized prokaryotic genomes, particularly when several closely related genome sequences are available.},

  abstract={Recognition of transcription regulation sites (operators) is a hard problem in computational molecular biology. In most cases, small sample size and low degree of sequence conservation preclude the construction of reliable recognition rules. We suggest an approach to this problem based on simultaneous analysis of several related genomes. It appears that as long as a gene coding for a transcription regulator is conserved in the compared bacterial genomes, the regulation of the respective group of genes (regulons) also tends to be maintained. Thus a gene can be confidently predicted to belong to a particular regulon in case not only itself, but also its orthologs in other genomes have candidate operators in the regulatory regions. This provides for a greater sensitivity of operator identification as even relatively weak signals are likely to be functionally relevant when conserved. We use this approach to analyze the purine (PurR), arginine (ArgR) and aromatic amino acid (TrpR and TyrR) regulons of Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. Candidate binding sites in regulatory regions of the respective H.influenzae genes are identified, a new family of purine transport proteins predicted to belong to the PurR regulon is described, and probable regulation of arginine transport by ArgR is demonstrated. Differences in the regulation of some orthologous genes in E.coli and H.influenzae, in particular the apparent lack of the autoregulation of the purine repressor gene in H.influenzae, are demonstrated.},

Their algorithm (restricted to distance calculation) proceeds in two stages: in the first stage, the overlap graph induced by the permutation is decomposed into connected components; then, in the second stage, certain graph structures (hurdles and others) are identified. Berman and Hannenhalli avoided the explicit computation of the overlap graph and gave an O(nalpha(n)) algorithm, based on a Union-Find structure, to find its connected components, where alpha is the inverse Ackerman function. Since for all practical purposes alpha(n) is a constant no larger than four, this algorithm has been the fastest practical algorithm to date. In this paper, we present a new linear-time algorithm for computing the connected components, which is more efficient than that of Berman and Hannenhalli in both theory and practice. Our algorithm uses only a stack and is very easy to implement. We give the results of computational experiments over a large range of permutation pairs produced through simulated evolution; our experiments show a speed-up by a factor of 2 to 5 in the computation of the connected components and by a factor of 1.3 to 2 in the overall distance computation.},

  abstract={As large portions of related genomes are being sequenced, methods for comparing complete or nearly complete genomes, as opposed to comparing individual genes, are becoming progressively more important. A major, widespread phenomenon in genome evolution is the rearrangement of genes and gene blocks. There is, however, no consistent method for genome sequence comparison combined with the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of highly rearranged genomes. We developed a schema for genome sequence comparison that includes three successive steps: (i) comparison of all proteins encoded in different genomes and generation of genomic similarity plots; (ii) construction of an alphabet of conserved genes and gene blocks; and (iii) generation of most parsimonious genome rearrangement scenarios. The approach is illustrated by a comparison of the herpesvirus genomes that constitute the largest set of relatively long, complete genome sequences available to date. Herpesviruses have from 70 to about 200 genes; comparison of the amino acid sequences encoded in these genes results in an alphabet of about 30 conserved genes comprising 7 conserved blocks that are rearranged in the genomes of different herpesviruses. Algorithms to analyze rearrangements of multiple genomes were developed and applied to the derivation of most parsimonious scenarios of herpesvirus evolution under different evolutionary models. The developed approaches to genome comparison will be applicable to the comparative analysis of bacterial and eukaryotic genomes as soon as their sequences become available.},

A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.},

FASTA includes an additional step in the calculation of the initial pairwise similarity score that allows multiple regions of similarity to be joined to increase the score of related sequences. The RDF2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity scores using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition. The LFASTA program can display all the regions of local similarity between two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using the same scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these local similarities can be displayed as a "graphic matrix" plot or as individual alignments.

  abstract={The FASTA3 and FASTA2 packages provide a flexible set of sequence-comparison programs that are particularly valuable because of their accurate statistical estimates and high-quality alignments. Traditionally, sequence similarity searches have sought to ask one question: "Is my query sequence homologous to anything in the database?" Both FASTA and BLAST can provide reliable answers to this question with their statistical estimates; if the expectation value E is < 0.001-0.01 and you are not doing hundreds of searches a day, the answer is probably yes. In general, the most effective search strategies follow these rules: 1. Whenever possible, compare at the amino acid level, rather than the nucleotide level. Search first with protein sequences (blastp, fasta3, and ssearch3), then with translated DNA sequences (fastx, blastx), and only at the DNA level as a last resort (Table 5). 2. Search the smallest database that is likely to contain the sequence of interest (but it must contain many unrelated sequences for accurate statistical estimates). 3. Use sequence statistics, rather than percent identity or percent similarity, as your primary criterion for sequence homology. 4. Check that the statistics are likely to be accurate by looking for the highest-scoring unrelated sequence, using prss3 to confirm the expectation, and searching with shuffled copies of the query sequence [randseq, searches with shuffled sequences should have E approx 1.0]. 5. Consider searches with different gap penalties and other scoring matrices. Searches with long query sequences against full-length sequence libraries will not change dramatically when BLOSUM62 is used instead of BLOSUM50 (20), or a gap penalty of -14/-2 is used in place of -12/-2. However, shallower or more stringent scoring matrices are more effective at uncovering relationships in partial sequences (3,18), and they can be used to sharpen dramatically the scope of the similarity search. However, as illustrated in the last section, the E value is only the first step in characterizing a sequence relationship. Once one has confidence that the sequences are homologous, one should look at the sequence alignments and percent identities, particularly when searching with lower quality sequences. When sequence alignments are very short, the alignment should become more significant when a shallower scoring matrix is used, e.g., BLOSUM62 rather than BLOSUM50 (remember to change the gap penalties). Homology can be reliably inferred from statistically significant similarity. Whereas homology implies common three-dimensional structure, homology need not imply common function. Orthologous sequences usually have similar functions, but paralogous sequences often acquire very different functional roles. Motif databases, such as PROSITE (21), can provide evidence for the conservation of critical functional residues. However, motif identity in the absence of overall sequence similarity is not a reliable indicator of homology.},

The resulting alignments are found in order of score, with the highest scoring alignment first. In the case of single gaps or multiple gaps weighted linear with gap length, the algorithm is extremely efficient, taking very little time beyond that of the initial calculation of the matrix. The algorithm is applied to comparisons of tRNA-rRNA sequences from Escherichia coli. A statistical analysis is important for proper evaluation of the results, which differ substantially from the results of an earlier analysis of the same sequences by Bloch and colleagues.},

  abstract={A dynamic-programming strategy for sequence alignment first proposed in 1975 by Dan Hirschberg can be adapted to yield a number of extremely space-efficient algorithms. Specifically, these algorithms align two sequences using only "linear space," i.e., an amount of computer memory that is proportional to the sum of the lengths of the two sequences being aligned. This paper begins by reviewing the basic idea, as it applies to the global (i.e., end-to-end) alignment of two DNA or protein sequences. Three of our recent extensions of the technique are then outlined. The first extension computes an optimal alignment subject to the constraint that each position, i, of the first sequence must be aligned somewhere between positions L[i] and U[i] of the second sequence, for given values of L and U. The second finds all aligned position pairs (i.e., potential columns of the alignment) that occur in an alignment whose score exceeds a given threshold. The third treats the case where each of the two sequences is allowed to be an alignment (e.g., a sequence of aligned pairs), using a sensitive scoring scheme. We also describe two linear-space methods for computing k best local (i.e., involving only a part of each sequence) alignments, where k > or = 1. One is a linear-space version of the algorithm of Waterman and Eggert (1987), and the other is based on the strategy proposed by Wilbur and Lipman (1983). Finally, we describe programs that implement various combinations of these techniques to provide a multisequence alignment method that is especially suited to handling a few very long sequences. The utility of these programs is illustrated by analysis of the locus control region of the beta-like globin gene cluster of several mammals.},

Two DNA sequences are given, where the shorter sequence is very similar to some contiguous region of the longer sequence. Sim3 determines such a similar region of the longer sequence, and then computes an optimal set of single-nucleotide changes (i.e. insertions, deletions or substitutions) that will convert the shorter sequence to that region. Thus, the alignment scoring scheme is designed to model sequencing errors, rather than evolutionary processes. The program can align a 100 kb sequence to a 1 megabase sequence in a few seconds on a workstation, provided that there are very few differences between the shorter sequence and some region in the longer sequence. The program has been used to assemble sequence data for the Genomes Division at the National Center for Biotechnology Information.},

  abstract={This paper presents a practical program, called sim2, for building local alignments of two sequences, each of which may be hundreds of kilobases long. sim2 first constructs n best non-intersecting chains of 'fragments', such as all occurrences of identical 5-tuples in each of two DNA sequences, for any specified n > or = 1. Each chain is then refined by delivering an optimal alignment in a region delimited by the chain. sim2 requires only space proportional to the size of the input sequences and the output alignments, and the same source code runs on Unix machines, on Macintoshes, on PCs, and on DEC Alpha PCs. We also describe an application of sim2 for aligning long DNA sequences from Escherichia coli. sim2 facilitates contig-building by providing a complete view of the related sequences, so differences can be analyzed and inconsistencies resolved. Examples are shown using the alignment display and editing functions from the software tool ChromoScope.},

  abstract={Pairwise comparison of long stretches of genomic DNA sequence can identify regions conserved across species, which often indicate functional significance. However, the novel insights frequently must be windowed from a flood of information; for instance, running an alignment program on two 50-kilobase sequences might yield over a hundred pages of alignments. Direct inspection of such a volume of printed output is infeasible, or at best highly undesirable, and computer tools are needed to summarize the information, to assist in its analysis, and to report the findings. This paper describes two such software tools. One tool prepares publication-quality pictorial representations of alignments, while another facilitates interactive browsing of pairwise alignment data. Their effectiveness is illustrated by comparing the beta-like globin gene clusters between humans and rabbits. A second example compares the chloroplast genomes of tobacco and liverwort.},

For alignments computed by dynamic programming, current approaches for selecting similar regions may have potential flaws. For instance, the criterion of Smith and Waterman can lead to inclusion of an arbitrarily poor internal segment. Other approaches can generate an alignment scoring less than some of its internal segments.

Our algorithm runs in time proportional to the original alignment's length. Practical applications to alignments of genomic DNA sequences are described.},

  abstract={Given a strong match between regions of two sequences, how far can the match be meaningfully extended if gaps are allowed in the resulting alignment? The aim is to avoid searching beyond the point that a useful extension of the alignment is likely to be found. Without loss of generality, we can restrict attention to the suffixes of the sequences that follow the strong match, which leads to the following formal problem. Given two sequences and a fixed X > 0, align initial portions of the sequences subject to the constraint that no section of the alignment scores below -X. Our results indicate that computing an optimal alignment under this constraint is very expensive. However, less rigorous conditions on the alignment can be guaranteed by quite efficient algorithms. One of these variants has been implemented in a new release of the Blast suite of database search programs.},

abstract = {The sequence poly(dT-dG).poly(dC-dA) (TG-element) is a ubiquitous component of eucaryotic genomes and has the potential to adopt a left-handed DNA conformation (Z-DNA). In this report, we have tested the hypothesis that the TG-element can modulate gene expression. Human genomic DNA fragments (1 to 1.5 kilobases) containing a (dT-dG)n.(dC-dA)n tract (30, 40, or 50 base pairs) or chemically synthesized (dT-dG)n.(dC-dA)n fragments (50 to 130 base pairs) were inserted in the pSV2-cat (simian virus 40 enhancer plus) or pA10-cat (enhancer minus) expression vector plasmid. These constructs were transfected into CV-1 cells or HeLa cells, and their transcription was monitored by assaying chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity. The results showed that pSV2-cat with the TG-element and pA10-cat with the TG-element synthesized more chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity (2 to 10 times, depending on the location of the TG-element) than did parental pSV2-cat and pA10-cat DNAs, respectively. Furthermore, the TG-element appeared to have characteristics similar to those of viral enhancers: (i) the TG-element enhanced transcription from a distance, (ii) its closer location to the promoter was more effective, and (iii) its orientation was not crucial. However, its enhancer-like activity was much weaker than that of the simian virus 40 enhancer, and, unlike many viral enhancers, it was equally active in monkey and in human cells. These results suggest that the TG-element may influence the expression of cellular genes.

abstract = {Previous analysis of the hsp26 gene of Drosophila melanogaster has shown that in addition to the TATA box and the proximal and distal heat shock elements (HSEs) (centered at -59 and -340, relative to the start site of transcription), a segment of (CT)n repeats at -135 to -85 is required for full heat shock inducibility (R.L. Glaser, G.H. Thomas, E.S. Siegfried, S.C.R. Elgin, and J.T. Lis, J. Mol. Biol. 211:751-761, 1990). This (CT)n element appears to contribute to formation of the wild-type chromatin structure of hsp26, an organized nucleosome array that leaves the HSEs in nucleosome-free, DNase I-hypersensitive (DH) sites (Q. Lu, L.L. Wallrath, B.D. Allan, R.L. Glaser, J.T. Lis, and S.C.R. Elgin, J. Mol. Biol. 225:985-998, 1992). Inspection of the sequences upstream of hsp26 has revealed an additional (CT)n element at -347 to -341, adjacent to the distal HSE. We have analyzed the contribution of this distal (CT)n element (-347 to -341), the proximal (CT)n element (-135 to -85), and the two HSEs both to the formation of the chromatin structure and to heat shock inducibility. hsp26 constructs containing site-directed mutations, deletions, substitutions, or rearrangements of these sequence elements have been fused in frame to the Escherichia coli lacZ gene and reintroduced into the D. melanogaster genome by P-element-mediated germ line transformation. Chromatin structure of the transgenes was analyzed (prior to gene activation) by DNase I or restriction enzyme treatment of isolated nuclei, and heat-inducible expression was monitored by measuring beta-galactosidase activity. The results indicate that mutations, deletions, or substitutions of either the distal or the proximal (CT)n element affect the chromatin structure and heat-inducible expression of the transgenes. These (CT)n repeats are associated with a nonhistone protein(s) in vivo and are bound by a purified Drosophila protein, the GAGA factor, in vitro. In contrast, the HSEs are required for heat-inducible expression but play only a minor role in establishing the chromatin structure of the transgenes. Previous analysis indicates that prior to heat shock, these HSEs appear to be free of protein. Our results suggest that GAGA factor, an abundant protein factor required for normal expression of many Drosophila genes, and heat shock factor, a specific transcription factor activated upon heat shock, play distinct roles in gene regulation: the GAGA factor establishes and/or maintains the DH sites prior to heat shock induction, while the activated heat shock factor recognizes and binds HSEs located within the DH sites to trigger transcription.

We demonstrate that the fraglle X p(CCG)n repeat Itself Is methylated In vivo and that methylation of this repeat Is able to Inhibit In vitro binding of a novel, specific nuclear p(CCG)n binding protein (CCG-BP1)-one of at least 10 distinct simple tandem repeat sequence binding proteins (STR-BPs).

An additional 54 kD band was present for the three primate species examined. The single-stranded d(TC)n binding activity was confirmed with bandshift assay. Specific double- stranded binding activity for duplex d(TC)n d(GA)n or single-stranded d(GA)n was not detected.

hybridization of (dC-dA)n.(dG-dT)n to the polytene
chromosomes
    of Drosophila melanogaster reveals a clearly
non-random distribution of chromosomal sites for this
sequence.
    Sites are distributed over most euchromatic
regions but the density of sites along the X
chromosome is
    significantly higher than the density over the
autosomes. All autosomes show approximately equal
levels
    of hybridization except chromosome 4 which has no
detectable stretches of (dC-dA)n.(dG-dT)n. Another
    striking feature is the lack of hybridization of
the beta-heterochromatin of the chromocenter. The
specific
    sites are conserved between different strains of
D. melanogaster. The same overall chromosomal pattern
    of hybridization is seen for the other Drosophila
species studied, including D. simulans, a sibling
species
    with a much lower content of middle repetitive
DNA, and D. virilis, a distantly related species. The
    evolutionary conservation of the distribution of
(dC-dA)n.(dG-dT)n suggests that these sequences are
    of functional importance. The distribution
patterns seen for D. pseudoobscura and D. miranda
raise interesting
    speculations about function. In these species a
chromosome equivalent to an autosomal arm of D.
melanogaster
    has been translocated onto the X chromosome and
acquired dosage compensation. In each species the new
    arm of the X also has a higher density of
(dC-dA)n.(dG-dT)n similar to that seen on other X
chromosomes.
    In addition to correlations with dosage
compensation, the depletion of (dC-dA)n.(dG-dT)n in
beta-heterochromatin
    and chromosome 4 may also be related to the fact
that these regions do not normally undergo meiotic
recombination.},

  abstract={Trimeric and
tetrameric short tandem repeats (STRs) represent a
rich source
    of highly polymorphic markers in the human genome
that may be studied with the polymerase chain reaction
    (PCR). We report the analysis of a multilocus
genotype survey of 97-380 chromosomes in U.S. Black,
White,
    Mexican-American, and Asian populations at five
STR loci located on chromosomes 1, 4, 11, and X. The
    heterozygote frequencies of the loci ranged from
0.36 to 0.91 and the number of alleles from 6 to 20
    for the 20 population and locus combinations.
Relative allele frequencies exhibited differences
between
    populations and unimodal, bimodal, and complex
distributions. Although deviations were noted at some
    locus-population test combinations, genotype data
from the loci were consistent overall with
Hardy-Weinberg
    equilibrium by three tests. Population
subheterogeneity within each ethnic group was not
detected by
    two additional tests. No mutations were detected
in a total of 860 meioses for two loci studied in the
    CEPH kindreds and five loci studied in other
families. An indirect estimate of the mutation rates
gave
    values from 2.3 x 10(-5) to 15.9 x 10(-5) for the
five loci. Higher mutation rates appear to be
associated
    with greater numbers of tandem repeats in the core
motif. The most frequent genotype for all five loci
    combined appears to have a frequency of 7.59 x
10(-4). Together, these results suggest that trimeric
    and tetrameric STR loci are useful markers for the
study of new mutations and genetic linkage analysis
    and for application to personal identification in
the medical and forensic sciences.},

  abstract={The genus Xanthomonas is a diverse and economically important group of bacterial phytopathogens, belonging to the gamma-subdivision of the Proteobacteria. Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Xac) causes citrus canker, which affects most commercial citrus cultivars, resulting in significant losses worldwide. Symptoms include canker lesions, leading to abscission of fruit and leaves and general tree decline. Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) causes black rot, which affects crucifers such as Brassica and Arabidopsis. Symptoms include marginal leaf chlorosis and darkening of vascular tissue, accompanied by extensive wilting and necrosis. Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris is grown commercially to produce the exopolysaccharide xanthan gum, which is used as a viscosifying and stabilizing agent in many industries. Here we report and compare the complete genome sequences of Xac and Xcc. Their distinct disease phenotypes and host ranges belie a high degree of similarity at the genomic level. More than 80% of genes are shared, and gene order is conserved along most of their respective chromosomes. We identified several groups of strain-specific genes, and on the basis of these groups we propose mechanisms that may explain the differing host specificities and pathogenic processes.},

Although a diverse sampling of Asteraceae experienced substantial length variation and base substitution during the long evolutionary history subsequent to the inversion events, the precise locations of the inversion end points are identified using comparative sequence alignments in the inversion regions. The phylogenetic distribution of two inversions is identical among the members of Asteraceae, suggesting that the inversion events likely occurred simultaneously or within a short time period shortly after the origin of the family. Estimates of divergence times based on ndhF and rbcL sequences suggest that two inversions originated during the late Eocene (38-42 MYA).

The positioning of this misalignment and of the realignment of the leading strand back into the leading-strand template will determine if the inversion is accompanied by deletion and duplication of sequence. We suggest that such strand misalignment-realignment events may occur at the replication fork during concurrent DNA replication.},

  abstract={With a draft genome-sequence assembly for the chimpanzee available, it is now possible to perform genome-wide analyses to identify, at a submicroscopic level, structural rearrangements that have occurred between chimpanzees and humans. The goal of this study was to investigate chromosomal regions that are inverted between the chimpanzee and human genomes. Using the net alignments for the builds of the human and chimpanzee genome assemblies, we identified a total of 1,576 putative regions of inverted orientation, covering more than 154 mega-bases of DNA. The DNA segments are distributed throughout the genome and range from 23 base pairs to 62 mega-bases in length. For the 66 inversions more than 25 kilobases (kb) in length, 75% were flanked on one or both sides by (often unrelated) segmental duplications. Using PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization we experimentally validated 23 of 27 (85%) semi-randomly chosen regions; the largest novel inversion confirmed was 4.3 mega-bases at human Chromosome 7p14. Gorilla was used as an out-group to assign ancestral status to the variants. All experimentally validated inversion regions were then assayed against a panel of human samples and three of the 23 (13%) regions were found to be polymorphic in the human genome. These polymorphic inversions include 730 kb (at 7p22), 13 kb (at 7q11), and 1 kb (at 16q24) fragments with a 5%, 30%, and 48% minor allele frequency, respectively. Our results suggest that inversions are an important source of variation in primate genome evolution. The finding of at least three novel inversion polymorphisms in humans indicates this type of structural variation may be a more common feature of our genome than previously realized.},

  abstract={Gene order evolution in two eukaryotes was studied by comparing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome sequence to extensive new data from whole-genome shotgun and cosmid sequencing of Candida albicans. Gene order is substantially different between these two yeasts, with only 9% of gene pairs that are adjacent in one species being conserved as adjacent in the other. Inversion of small segments of DNA, less than 10 genes long, has been a major cause of rearrangement, which means that even where a pair of genes has been conserved as adjacent, the transcriptional orientations of the two genes relative to one another are often different. We estimate that about 1,100 single-gene inversions have occurred since the divergence between these species. Other genes that are adjacent in one species are in the same neighborhood in the other, but their precise arrangement has been disrupted, probably by multiple successive multigene inversions. We estimate that gene adjacencies have been broken as frequently by local rearrangements as by chromosomal translocations or long-distance transpositions. A bias toward small inversions has been suggested by other studies on animals and plants and may be general among eukaryotes.},

The complete genome sequence has revealed an unusual breadth (in number and in effect) of DNA inversion events that potentially control expression of many different components, including surface and secreted components, regulatory molecules, and restriction-modification proteins. Invertible promoters of two different types (12 group 1 and 11 group 2) were identified. One group has inversion crossover (fix) sites similar to the hix sites of Salmonella typhimurium. There are also four independent intergenic shufflons that potentially alter the expression and function of varied genes. The composition of the 10 different polysaccharide biosynthesis gene clusters identified (7 with associated invertible promoters) suggests a mechanism of synthesis similar to the O-antigen capsules of Escherichia coli.},

We find corresponding differences in their genomes, based on determination of the genome sequence of BF and comparative analysis with BT. Both species have acquired two mechanisms that contribute to their dominance among the colonic microbiota: an exceptional capability to use a wide range of dietary polysaccharides by gene amplification and the capacity to create variable surface antigenicities by multiple DNA inversion systems. However, the gene amplification for polysaccharide assimilation is more developed in BT, in keeping with its internal localization. In contrast, external antigenic structures can be changed more systematically in BF. Thereby, at the mucosal surface, where microbes encounter continuous attack by host defenses, BF evasion of the immune system is favored, and its colonization and infectious potential are increased.},

The size of the inversion (approximately 200 bp) places it in a class not previously seen in the plastid genome. The two lineages with the rearrangement, representatives of the orders Laurales and Nymphaeales, are not closely related and the inversion therefore probably arose independently in each group. The inversion is bordered by short, but highly conserved, inverted repeat motifs that were most likely associated with the inversion process. A stem-loop structure that involves these motifs may play a functional role in mRNA stability. It is seen in all optimal or nearly optimal predicted RNA foldings of the intergenic region.},

It appears that the two pairs of target site duplications generated upon insertion were exchanged during the inversion event, and that the inversion arose by ectopic recombination between two copies of the transposon that were in opposite orientations. This is apparently the mechanism by which transposable elements generate natural inversions in Drosophila.},

  abstract={Complex mutational events, including de novo inversion with deletion and duplication of sequence, have been observed but are difficult to model. We propose that nascent leading-strand misalignment upon the lagging-strand template during DNA replication can result in the inversion of sequence. The positioning of this misalignment and of the realignment of the leading strand back into the leading-strand template will determine if the inversion is accompanied by deletion and duplication of sequence. We suggest that such strand misalignment-realignment events may occur at the replication fork during concurrent DNA replication.},

  abstract={With a draft genome-sequence assembly for the chimpanzee available, it is now possible to perform genome-wide analyses to identify, at a submicroscopic level, structural rearrangements that have occurred between chimpanzees and humans. The goal of this study was to investigate chromosomal regions that are inverted between the chimpanzee and human genomes. Using the net alignments for the builds of the human and chimpanzee genome assemblies, we identified a total of 1,576 putative regions of inverted orientation, covering more than 154 mega-bases of DNA. The DNA segments are distributed throughout the genome and range from 23 base pairs to 62 mega-bases in length. For the 66 inversions more than 25 kilobases (kb) in length, 75% were flanked on one or both sides by (often unrelated) segmental duplications. Using PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization we experimentally validated 23 of 27 (85%) semi-randomly chosen regions; the largest novel inversion confirmed was 4.3 mega-bases at human Chromosome 7p14. Gorilla was used as an out-group to assign ancestral status to the variants. All experimentally validated inversion regions were then assayed against a panel of human samples and three of the 23 (13%) regions were found to be polymorphic in the human genome. These polymorphic inversions include 730 kb (at 7p22), 13 kb (at 7q11), and 1 kb (at 16q24) fragments with a 5%, 30%, and 48% minor allele frequency, respectively. Our results suggest that inversions are an important source of variation in primate genome evolution. The finding of at least three novel inversion polymorphisms in humans indicates this type of structural variation may be a more common feature of our genome than previously realized.},

  abstract={Gene order evolution in two eukaryotes was studied by comparing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome sequence to extensive new data from whole-genome shotgun and cosmid sequencing of Candida albicans. Gene order is substantially different between these two yeasts, with only 9% of gene pairs that are adjacent in one species being conserved as adjacent in the other. Inversion of small segments of DNA, less than 10 genes long, has been a major cause of rearrangement, which means that even where a pair of genes has been conserved as adjacent, the transcriptional orientations of the two genes relative to one another are often different. We estimate that about 1,100 single-gene inversions have occurred since the divergence between these species. Other genes that are adjacent in one species are in the same neighborhood in the other, but their precise arrangement has been disrupted, probably by multiple successive multigene inversions. We estimate that gene adjacencies have been broken as frequently by local rearrangements as by chromosomal translocations or long-distance transpositions. A bias toward small inversions has been suggested by other studies on animals and plants and may be general among eukaryotes.},

The complete genome sequence has revealed an unusual breadth (in number and in effect) of DNA inversion events that potentially control expression of many different components, including surface and secreted components, regulatory molecules, and restriction-modification proteins. Invertible promoters of two different types (12 group 1 and 11 group 2) were identified. One group has inversion crossover (fix) sites similar to the hix sites of Salmonella typhimurium. There are also four independent intergenic shufflons that potentially alter the expression and function of varied genes. The composition of the 10 different polysaccharide biosynthesis gene clusters identified (7 with associated invertible promoters) suggests a mechanism of synthesis similar to the O-antigen capsules of Escherichia coli.},

  abstract={Bacteroides are predominant human colonic commensals, but the principal pathogenic species, Bacteroides fragilis (BF), lives closely associated with the mucosal surface, whereas a second major species, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BT), concentrates within the colon. We find corresponding differences in their genomes, based on determination of the genome sequence of BF and comparative analysis with BT. Both species have acquired two mechanisms that contribute to their dominance among the colonic microbiota: an exceptional capability to use a wide range of dietary polysaccharides by gene amplification and the capacity to create variable surface antigenicities by multiple DNA inversion systems. However, the gene amplification for polysaccharide assimilation is more developed in BT, in keeping with its internal localization. In contrast, external antigenic structures can be changed more systematically in BF. Thereby, at the mucosal surface, where microbes encounter continuous attack by host defenses, BF evasion of the immune system is favored, and its colonization and infectious potential are increased.},

The size of the inversion (approximately 200 bp) places it in a class not previously seen in the plastid genome. The two lineages with the rearrangement, representatives of the orders Laurales and Nymphaeales, are not closely related and the inversion therefore probably arose independently in each group. The inversion is bordered by short, but highly conserved, inverted repeat motifs that were most likely associated with the inversion process. A stem-loop structure that involves these motifs may play a functional role in mRNA stability. It is seen in all optimal or nearly optimal predicted RNA foldings of the intergenic region.},

The breakpoints of the cosmopolitan inversion 2j of D. buzzatii were cloned and sequenced. Both breakpoints contain large insertions corresponding to a transposable element. It appears that the two pairs of target site duplications generated upon insertion were exchanged during the inversion event, and that the inversion arose by ectopic recombination between two copies of the transposon that were in opposite orientations. This is apparently the mechanism by which transposable elements generate natural inversions in Drosophila.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:The tools that are available to draw and to manipulate the representations of metabolism are usually restricted to metabolic pathways. This limitation becomes problematic when studying processes that span several pathways. The various attempts that have been made to draw genome-scale metabolic networks are confronted with two shortcomings: 1- they do not use contextual information which leads to dense, hard to interpret drawings, 2- they impose to fit to very constrained standards, which implies, in particular, duplicating nodes making topological analysis considerably more difficult.RESULTS:We propose a method, called MetaViz, which enables to draw a genome-scale metabolic network and that also takes into account its structuration into pathways. This method consists in two steps: a clustering step which addresses the pathway overlapping problem and a drawing step which consists in drawing the clustered graph and each cluster.CONCLUSION:The method we propose is original and addresses new drawing issues arising from the no-duplication constraint. We do not propose a single drawing but rather several alternative ways of presenting metabolism depending on the pathway on which one wishes to focus. We believe that this provides a valuable tool to explore the pathway structure of metabolism.},

Here we describe PRIAM, a method for automated enzyme detection in a fully sequenced genome, based on the classification of enzymes in the ENZYME database. PRIAM relies on sets of position-specific scoring matrices ( profiles') automatically tailored for each ENZYME entry. Automatically generated logical rules define which of these profiles is required in order to infer the presence of the corresponding enzyme in an organism. As an example, PRIAM was applied to identify potential metabolic pathways from the complete genome of the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti. The results of this automated method were compared with the original genome annotation and visualised on KEGG graphs in order to facilitate the interpretation of metabolic pathways and to highlight potentially missing enzymes.

The software performs multiple computational inferences including prediction of metabolic pathways, prediction of metabolic pathway hole fillers and prediction of operons. It enables interactive editing of PGDBs by DB curators. It supports web publishing of PGDBs, and provides a large number of query and visualization tools. The software also supports comparative analyses of PGDBs, and provides several systems biology analyses of PGDBs including reachability analysis of metabolic networks, and interactive tracing of metabolites through a metabolic network. More than 800 PGDBs have been created using Pathway Tools by scientists around the world, many of which are curated DBs for important model organisms. Those PGDBs can be exchanged using a peer-to-peer DB sharing system called the PGDB Registry.
